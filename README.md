# Election_Analysis
## Overview
### The purpose of this project was to provide our client the election comission, with data to complete their election audit. Our raw data was provided as a csv file with over 300k rows of data. Using pythons for loops and conditional statements we were able to pull from our data and provide the rquired results the comission wanted such as Counties and their winning vote counts. We were then able to not only display this in the python terminal but also write it to a seperate file so that anyone could easily access the results.

## Election Audit Results
### The results of the election are as follows.

## Election Audit Summary
### Using this script we were able to determine the results of the election without having to comb through each row of data. This script was able to comb through the data and instantly provide us with our desired results. This scirpt is ready to be used for any election with a similar data format. We can adapt our script to work with any kind of raw data. For example, if the formatting of the csv is different and the names and votes are in different locations we can adjust the rows from whiche we extract our information from by changing the row numbers in our python script. We can also edit our code by creating new variables and implementing these variables to handle new columns of data.
